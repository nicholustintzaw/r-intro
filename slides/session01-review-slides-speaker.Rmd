# Goals

???

For the next two days, our goals are to support you in this by allowing for more group work, exposure to new projects and datasets, and more engagement with us. Specifically...[CLICK]

1. Practice with some familiar wrangling skills and explore new ones [CLICK]

1. Learn best practices for exploring your data and reporting it reproducibly

In short, we hope the next two days allow you to do a deep-dive into the skills you've been learning the past few weeks, to apply new skills you'll learn, and take advantage of a lot of protected time for practice.

???

Each session, you'll be seated at the same table with your group. If there is group-presenting involved during the session, then you'll sign on to zoom using the link you usually use for group sessions. 

But turn your audio and camera off. The only thing necessary is screensharing, which your mentor will have you do as normal when it's time.

For other forms of code sharing as well as announcements, we can continue to use slack.

## `r emo::ji("rocket")` Rapid fire review 


```{r label, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/session01/your-turn-example.png")
```

???

What we'll do:

I'm going to give you a prompt with a short tidyverse task, and you'll work to recreate it. 

You'll do your work in the R Markdown document you have open so you have a record of your code. You can create as many new code chunks as you like in here. 


---

<!-- TODO: update -->

# Review challenge rules

* For each prompt, the __first group with 4 or more people to have the answer correct__ (as verified by your mentor), scores a point.

--

* You must have the __correct code__ *and* the __correct output__.

--

* __Working together__ with your groupmates is encouraged.

--

* After 1-2 minutes, we'll go over the answer together. And then move on to the next question. 

--

* Group with the most points at the end wins (a small prize!)

???

For each prompt, the first group with 4 or more people to have the correct answer, scores a point.

You must have the correct code and output.

Working together is okay (and encouraged)

We'll go over the answer once I see that most groups have finished.

There are 20 prompts -- we may get through all of them (or not). But there will be a prize for the winning group at the end. 

I should also note that there's a bit of a mish mash of difficulty. But The main idea is that you exercise some tidyverse recall and get warmed up.


After today, I'll share the slides with the prompts and the solutions so that you'll be able to refer back to them later.

You'll use the sticky system to signal to your mentor that you're ready for your code to be checked.

And your mentor will use a sticky to signal that the group has at least 4 correct answers.

...spread by contact with environmental sources or infected people or animals. I'll refer to this dataset as `outbreaks`. It comes from the CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS).

First things first, let's take a look a what's in this dataset. 

So *here* is your first prompt:

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 1

Read in the data and explore it. Can you recreate output that looks like this?

```{r read-in-outbreaks, include = FALSE}
outbreaks <- readr::read_csv("data/session01/outbreaks.csv")
```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
glimpse(outbreaks)
#str(outbreaks)

outbreaks <- 
  read_csv("data/outbreaks.csv")

glimpse(outbreaks)
```
]

.pull-right.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
glimpse(outbreaks)
```
]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 2

What is the **earliest year** on record in this dataset? __The latest__? 

Answer the questions by creating two tables that are sorted.

---

## Solution 2

.pull-left[
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(year)
```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(year) %>%

```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(desc(year)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```
]
]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 3

The `state` variable appears to include US locations -- is the data limited to the 50 states? 

Produce a table that displays all the unique values of this variable.


---

## Solution 3

```{r sol-3, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  distinct(state)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
outbreaks %>%
  distinct(state) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 4

What are the different etiologies that have been recorded in this dataset, and how often do they appear in the data? Display your results in a table like the one below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

---

## Solution 4

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 5

Let's turn our attention to only observations where the primary mode of infection is Food. Using that criterion, can you reproduce the table below?

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

???

---

## Solution 5

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 6

.pull-left[
Explore the relationship between `month` and the number of illnesses with a series of **boxplots** like the one to the right. Can you recreate it? 
]

.pull-right[
```{r sol-6, echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = illnesses)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = month)) #<<
```
]


???

Check documentation for use of the argument that allows you to create a new boxplot for each grouping.

---

## Solution 6

.wide-left[
```{r ref.label = "sol-6", fig.show = "hide"}
```
]

.narrow-right[
```{r ref.label = "sol-6", echo = FALSE}
```
]

???

But outlier here makes it hard to see what's going on. Let's modify this.

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 7

Which observation in `outbreaks` is the outlier associated with such a high number of illnesses? 

  * Display solely this observation in a table. 

  * Then, recreate the boxplots **without** this observation.

---
class: space-saver

## Solution 7

.pull-left[

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses == max(illnesses))
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses == max(illnesses)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

<br>

]

--

.pull-left[
```{r sol-7-fig, fig.asp = 1/2, fig.show = "hide"}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses != max(illnesses)) %>% #<<

  geom_boxplot(aes(group = month))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label= "sol-7-fig", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 3/5}

```

]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 8

Which outbreaks lead to the highest number of illnesses? Display these observations in a table from greatest to fewest illnesses.

---
class: space-saver

## Solution 8

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% arrange(desc(illnesses))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% arrange(desc(illnesses)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 9

How many different primary modes of illness are in this dataset? How often does each appear in the data?

Order the rows so that the most common primary mode appears at the top. 

---

## Solution 9

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

???

Looks like the most common primary moe for outbreaks in this particular dataset is person-to-person.

???

Notice coord_flip()

If your first inclination was to use count() then you might have come up with an answer like...

## Solution 10 - alternative

.wide-left[
```{r sol-10-alt, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode, name = "count") %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = primary_mode, y = count)) + 
  geom_col() + #<<
  coord_flip()
```
]

.narrow-right[
```{r ref.label = "sol-10-alt", echo = FALSE}

```
]

???

This one, but it's a little less efficient code-wise.

# Your Turn 11 

Let's take a closer look at outbreaks associated with **Animal Contact**. 

* Which *individual* states have had the most Animal Contact outbreaks -- how many has each state had? 

* Create a table to answer these questions.  


---

## Solution 11

One possible solution:

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Animal Contact") %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(state != "Multistate") %>%  #<<
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Animal Contact") %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(state != "Multistate") %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

# Your Turn 20 - last one!

Find Washington DC's worst outbreak as defined by its **`hospitalization_rate`** (which you will need to calculate).
